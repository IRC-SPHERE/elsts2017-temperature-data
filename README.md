This contains accompanying datasets for the paper:

> Atis Elsts, Xenofon Fafoutis, Simon Duquennoy, George Oikonomou, Robert Piechocki and Ian Craddock, *Temperature-Resilient Time Synchronization for the Internet of Things*, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics.

It contains both temperature measurements (by on-board HDC temperature sensors) in `.csv` files and the resulting drifts, in form of log outputs generated by the embedded devices.


# File formats

The **CSV files** contain the temperature measurements on the sensor nodes.

The **log files (.txt)** are just the raw logging output of nodes.  There are three types of lines one needs to extract:

```
1494298887.2 > TSCH: {asn-0.575016 link-0-0-0-0 ch-26} drift -65
1494298887.2 > TSCH: {asn-0.575016 link-0-0-0-0 ch-26} bc-0-0 35 rx 131, dr -2 (-24562), edr 2 (24562)
1494298887.4 > TSCH: {asn-0.57502b link-0-0-0-0 ch-20} bc-0-0 35 rx 131, edr 1 (-299)
```

- The `1494298887.2` is server time, in seconds.
- `asn-0.575016` is the ASN slot number, in the 5 byte hex notation.
- `drift -65` is the drift estimate of the sensor node. It's printed in custom units (1/1024 of a microsecond). It is only printed after its updated, and it's only updated on synchronization events.
- `dr -2 (-24562), edr 2 (24562)` shows that EB packet was received and used for synchronization.  `24562` is the corrected synchronization error, in 1/1024 of a microsecond. Time correction also triggers update of the `drift` value (which was already printed, in the line before this one).
- `edr 1 (-299)` shows that EB packet was received, but not used for syncronization. `-299` is the estimated error.

In the experiment, beacons were sent around once per second, but sync only once per several minutes (at least after the initial learning period). So we have few synchronization events, definitely much less than temperature sensing events.

We use these regular expressions to parse the lines (the server time is ignored):
```
regex_drift_value = ".*TSCH: {asn-([0-9a-f])\.([0-9a-f]+) .*} drift (-?[0-9]+)$"
regex_edr_line = ".*TSCH: {asn-([0-9a-f])\.([0-9a-f]+) .*} bc-.* rx 131, edr -?[0-9]+ \((-?[0-9]+)\)$"
regex_dr_line = ".*TSCH: {asn-([0-9a-f])\.([0-9a-f]+) .*} bc-.* rx 131, dr -?[0-9]+ \((-?[0-9]+)\), edr -?[0-9]+ \((-?[0-9]+)\)$"

```
